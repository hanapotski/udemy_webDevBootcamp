Loops

Objectives
Understand the purpose of loops
Define "DRY" code
Write simple while loops

WET - Write Everything Twice


While Loops
Repeat code WHILE a condition is true
while(someCondition) {
  //run some code
}
It's very similar to an if statement, except it repeats a given code block instead of just running it once
> will continue to run code as long as condition is true

Printing numbers from 1-5
var count = 1;

while(count < 6) {
 console.log("count is: " + count);
 count++;
}

//count is: 1
//count is: 2
//count is: 3
//count is: 4
//count is: 5


Printing each character in a string
//string we're looping over:
var str = "hello";
//first character is at index 0
var count = 0;

while(count < str.length) {
 console.log(str[count]);
 count++;
}

//"h"
//"e"
//"l"
//"l"
//"o"

Infinite loops occur when the terminating condition in a loop is never true
var count = 0;

while(count < 10) {
 console.log(count);
}
The above example prints "0" over and over because count is never incremented


Exercise 1
var num = 1;

while(num <= 10) {
  console.log(num);
  num += 2;
}

Exercise 2
var num = 1

while(num <= 20) {
 if(num % 4 === 0){
   console.log(num);
 }
 num++;
}

Exercise 3
var num = 100;

while(num < 150) {
  console.log(num + 1);
  num--;
}
