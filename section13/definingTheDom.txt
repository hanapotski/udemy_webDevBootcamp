Defining the DOM

The DOM
Document Object Model
The Document Object Model is the interface between your Javascript and HTML+CSS
- special JS objects, JS methods and functions used to interact with HTML and CSS
- change things, add elements, remove elements, animate things

The browser turns every HTML tag into a Javascript object that we can manipulate
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My title</title>
</head>
<body>
	<a href="someLink">My link</a>
	<h1>My header</h1>
</body>
</html>

Everything is stored inside of the document object
- html turned into JS objects, each objects models every element
- document - top-level object, root node

document
console.dir(document);
- all properties, methods, and nodes
